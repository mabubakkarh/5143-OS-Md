## How to Run?
Make sure your computer has python 3 installed. If you are using macOS, you will need to write python3. To run in windows, go to progress_bar.py and edit the line no 14- 
- os.system('clear')  
- os.system('cls')

Type python3 main.py -w (number of writer you want to input)
- python3 main.py -w 2 

If you wish to run with more than 5 writer, you can tune the latency of the output to make it run faster.
search "sleep" in progress bar file and you will find 3 different sleep to tinke with! :)
