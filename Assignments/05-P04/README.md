## How to Run?
Make sure your computer has python 3 installed. If you are using macOS, you will need to write python3. To run in windows, go to progress_bar.py and edit the line no 14- 
- os.system('clear')  
- os.system('cls')

Open the folder with terminal and follow these commands to run the program. Choose python version correctly. If you use python3 to run python files then use pip3 instead. Also for the next command use python.

- pip3 install -r requirements.txt
Afrer completing all the necessary packages run this command:

Now run the program by typing
- python3 Main.py


The program should be run 5 times to simulate race condition-
* With priority
* WIthout priority
* Sleep
* Run With priority again
* Run Without priority again

After every run generating a modified memory, we need to save the file with appropiate name to recognize the run.
